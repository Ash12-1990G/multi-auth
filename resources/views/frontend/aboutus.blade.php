<p>ACTI-INDIA was founded by experienced information technology professionals and instructors who decided to concentrate in the hottest and fastest growing Information Technology (IT) areas: E-Commerce, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), automated software testing, database administration and networking.</p>
<p>ACTI-INDIA has been educating computer professionals for long time  and has launched numerous successful careers in the field of information technology.<br>

The company employs talented instructors, who are seasoned IT professionals and bring depth of real workplace knowledge to their classrooms. We have built modern training facilities and computer networks with "industrial strength" versions of ERP and E-Commerce software and operating systems.<br>

ACTI-INDIA is conveniently located in Glenview, which is Chicago close northern suburb. In addition to taking classes, our students are encouraged to use the facility labs as much as they can, even after graduation, in order to maintain and advance their skills. The facility is opened 7 days a week; it is available weekday evenings and during weekends.</p>

<p>Our approach is to provide rigorous theoretical training while teaching our students extensive practical skills. We make every effort to prepare our students to face the challenges of today's rapidly evolving information technology marketplace. Our training manuals and exercise materials are very effective in enhancing students' knowledge and skills base. Students can take any of our courses separately or combine several of them to achieve higher levels of proficiency in information technology. Our instructors are not just experienced teachers, they are team leaders and senior technical developers who themselves mentor and coach new employees and consultants hired on their projects.<br>

As project leaders, our instructors also interview prospective candidates for permanent and consulting positions. They know first hand what skills students need to start a career in the IT field, pass job interviews, and successfully perform on the first job assignment. Our instructors work very hard and with a lot of personal attention to transfer that knowledge to each student and to keep the student well informed in all the latest industry developments.</p>

<p>All our graduates have a lifetime privilege: free use of placement services of Systegration and affiliate consulting and professional services companies.<br>

Our principals, experienced IT managers and professionals themselves, conduct the follow up sessions individually with each student free of charge: career counseling, resume writing, and mock job interviews with analysis. Our instructors will draw your attention to class topics frequently used on technical interviews.<br>

We have formed close partnerships and are on the preferred vendors list with several Chicago-land consulting firms and Fortune 500 companies developing large ERP, E-Commerce and QA applications. We actively seek employment for our graduates by our business partners.<br>

We also help our graduates to adjust to a new work environment after they are hired, advance in their professional career, and stay competitive and employable by learning hot new skills.<br>

Each graduate who is retained by one of our business partner firms as an employee or a contract programmer receives an additional bonus: full tuition reimbursement for all classes taken with ACTI-INDIA.
